The techniques performed on the dataset are: • Feature selection algorithms: o Lasso Regression o Ridge Regression

• Predictive Regression Models: o Linear Regression o Support Vector Regression o K Nearest Neighbors Regression o Random Forest Regression o XGBoost Regression

• 10 Fold Cross Validation

• Hyperparameter Tuning o Randomized Grid Search
